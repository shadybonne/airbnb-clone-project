This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.


## üèÜ Database Design
___________________________________

User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.

Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.

Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.

Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

##	CI/CD Pipeline
	___________________________________

CI/CD pipelines are a set of automated processes that bridge the gap between development and operations teams, enabling faster, more reliable, and more frequent software releases.

In essence, for an Airbnb clone, CI/CD means you can build, test, and release new features and bug fixes with high speed, confidence, and quality, which is paramount for user satisfaction and business success

### Here are some key tools that could be used:

CI/CD Orchestration Platforms: (These are the core engines that run your pipelines)

GitHub Actions: Integrated directly into GitHub repositories, great for projects already on GitHub.
GitLab CI/CD: Built into GitLab, offering a comprehensive all-in-one solution for Git, CI/CD, and more.
Jenkins: A powerful, highly customizable open-source automation server (often self-hosted).
CircleCI: A cloud-native CI/CD platform known for its speed and ease of use.
Azure DevOps Pipelines: Microsoft's offering, well-integrated with Azure services.
AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild/CodeDeploy: Amazon's suite of services for building and deploying applications on AWS.
Version Control System: (Where your code lives)

Git: The distributed version control system.
GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket: Hosting services for Git repositories, often providing their own integrated CI/CD solutions.
Containerization: (For packaging your application and its dependencies)

Docker: Essential for creating portable, self-contained application images.
Kubernetes (K8s): For orchestrating and managing containerized applications at scale (if deploying to a Kubernetes cluster).
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): (For provisioning and managing your infrastructure automatically)

Terraform: Cloud-agnostic tool for provisioning infrastructure (VMs, databases, networks) across various cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
